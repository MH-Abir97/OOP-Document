## Object-oriented programming is a real-world programing.Object-oriented programming is a way of developing software applications using real-world terminologies to create entities that interact with one another using objects. 


* Object-oriented programming makes applications flexible
* East to change or add new features
* Re-usable, well-structured, and easy to debug and test.

## 5 Basic building blocks to build object-oriented applications : -
* *Classes :* A Class define the structure using methods and properties/fields that resemble real-world entity.
* *Methods :* A method represents a particular behavior. It performs some action and might return information about an object, or update an objectâ€™s data.
* *Properties :* Properties hold the data temporarily during the execution of an application.
* *Objects:* Objects are instances of the class that holds different data in properties/fields and can interact with other objects.
* *Interfaces :* An interface is a contract that defines the set of rules for a particular functionality. They are used effectively with classes using OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism to make applications more flexible.

# **Object-oriented Design Principles**

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

# Abstraction : -
Abstraction is a higher-level concept or a way of thinking. When you start designing your application from the business requirement. Abstraction is a process of identifying essential entities (classes) and their characteristics (class members) and leaving irrelevant information from the business requirement to prepare a higher-level application design.

## Types of abstraction : -

 * Data Abstraction
 * Control Abstraction

 Data Abstraction : Data abstraction refers to the concealment of data specifics

 Control Abstraction : control abstraction refers to the concealment of implementation details.

 *Abstract classes :* an abstract class is a specific type of class that can not be instantiated, which means you can not make objects from it. An abstract class aims to create a skeleton framework from which other classes can derive.

 **Characteristics of abstract class and methods :**
 * Abstract class must be Used in Abustract Keyword.
 * Abstract Class are possible in abstract method.
 * Non Abstract Class aren`t possible in abstract Method.
 * Abstract method have no method body
 * Abstract method must be declar in abstract Keyword.


 public abstract class Demo

 {

    public abstract void k1();
 }


 public abstract class Demo

    {
        public abstract void Show();

        public virtual void Print() 
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Non Abstract");
        
        }

    }

    public class Sample : Demo
    
    {
        public override void Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(" Hello Demo !!!");
        }

        public override void Print()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Use Child Objecet");

        }
    }
